### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After a career in HR technology management, I have decided to fulfill a longstanding dream of formally studying areas of linguistic research that had been brewing in the back of my head as long as I remember. I am paricularly interested in Old English, its current morphology, syntax and grammar, as well as its evolvement from Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European.

I am currently enrolled in English studies at the University of Nottingham (distance learning), where I endeavor to study systematically and try to re-sharpen my academic skills while unlearning managerial overhead ;)

I do hold a degree in Psychology from the University of Bremen and an MBA from Henley Business School.
